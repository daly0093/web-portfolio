My web portfolio that I created was really fun to make! I enjoyed the process, especially since I was able to design it first in the User Experience Design course and was able to have that ability. It was a really unique and awesome assignment.

I feel like over the past few months of being in this course I have definitely improved a ton more in my coding capabilities compared to the first semester which is interesting to say the least because this semester was completely online.
