            <p>Photography is one of my main passions. I've loved photography and cameras since I was just a young kid. The science behind it all has always fascinated me. My favourite types of photographs to take are portraits and nature / wildlife photos. I currently use the Nikon D5600 camera with two lenses (18mm-55mm and 75mm-300mm). <br><br>Feel free to click the picture to see my full photography portfolio!</p>

            </div>
            <p>Another one of my main passions would have to be the world revolving around videography and recording. I feel as though I could get lost in it because of how much I love videography and using its many accessories. I wish to work more in this videography as a means of expanding my knowledge, understanding, and experience behind it. <br><br>Feel free to click the picture to see my full videography portfolio!</p>

            <p>I really enjoy and appreciate the world and many languages that surround coding as a whole. Native to C++, C# and python but more recently learning CSS and HTML, coding has definitely taught me a lot of things. Code has also 100% opened my creative side by allowing me to express my mind in ways I couldn't before. <br><br>Feel free to click the picture to see my full coding portfolio!</p>
